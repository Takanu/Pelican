# Pelican 0.8
## Telegram API Wrapper for Swift.

Hi, 2-3 people that somehow both like Telegram and Swift!   This package gives you a complete set of tools for making bots.
**It's still a little rough and not everything has been finished, so be careful**

If you’ve never heard of [Telegram](https://telegram.org) it’s an awesome non-profit, secure messaging service that offers a lot of great features, one of them being a free API system where you can make bots for all kinds of tasks, from helping schedule channel posts to operating your own online HTML5 games that are playable inside the app.

Pelican is a framework I've developed personally for my own Telegram games and has a lot of great features:

- Pelican automates the handling and distribution of updates through a unique session system that you can customise for your own specific needs - no need to make your own.
- It's multi-threaded by default, with thread-safe session update handling and quick APIs for delaying code and Telegram API calls.
- Features modular, tree-based routing systems for more advanced and interchangeable update sorting.

The code has extensive API documentation to help you use it, and I will include up-to-date tests and demo code soon.  If you have any questions, feel free to message me on GitHub or on Telegram [@takanu](https://t.me/takanu).
